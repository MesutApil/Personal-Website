Through out my experience in Texas State University I have put together complex projects as well as meeting incredible mentors. If I am not behind my computer coding or stressing over an assignment, I enjoy attending fun activities. Floating down the San Marcos river every once in a while is one of the best ways to relieve stress. ",
